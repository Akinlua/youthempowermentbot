Advice is like snow - the softer it falls, the longer it dwells upon, and the deeper it sinks into the mind.

Samuel Taylor Coleridge

When we ask for advice, we are usually looking for an accomplice.

Saul Bellow

Henri Nouwen

Jorge Ramos

“Let us reach out to the people and show them an abundance of goodwill. We must, however, learn to identify manipulations as well and uncover maneuvers in the dark if we do not want to be tricked by lying eyes. ("With confidence")”
― Erik Pevernagie

“At this very moment enormous numbers of intelligent men and women of goodwill are trying to build a better world. But problems are born faster than they can be solved.”
― B.F. Skinner, Walden Two

“The non-violent resistor not only avoids external, physical violence, but he avoids internal violence of spirit. He not only refuses to shoot his opponent, but he refuses to hate him. And he stands with understanding, goodwill at all times.”
― Martin Luther King Jr.
